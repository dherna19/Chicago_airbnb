# Chicago Airbnb data
This project analyzes Chicago Airbnb data and extracts insights from it

# Project Motivation
For this Udacity project, I have gathered Airbnb data for Chicago, IL rentals to answer some business questions, analyze, and gain insight from the data.

Are there any buzz words in listing names that are associated with more bookings?
-	What are top 10 most expensive neighborhoods?
-	What time of the year do prices spike?
-	Do higher priced rentals have better reviews?
-	What characteristics do higher priced homes have? 
-	What are most important factors that contribute to the price of a rental?

# Installation
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
- Pandas
- Sci-kit learn
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

# Data
I downloaded the data from Kaggle: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html 
File Descriptions
Jupyter Notebook, CSV files:
-	Listings.csv: Shows a description of listings as well as host information, and rental information, beds, neighborhood, review scores.
